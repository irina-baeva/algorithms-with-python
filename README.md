# Portfolio for SE_02 Algorithms and Data Structures

## The goal

<b> To learn how to analyse algorithms and to use different data structures </b>


### Reqired libraries:
* matplotlib
* numpy
* binarytree
* ipycytoscape

### Installation:

You will need Python 3 installed on your computer.

Clone the project

```s
git clone https://github.com/irina-baeva/algorithms-with-python.git
```

Create virtual environment

```s
python3 -m venv .venv
```

Activate virtual environment

```s
source .venv/bin/activate
```

To install the latest releases of libraries, you can use pip

```s
pip install matplotlib numpy binarytree ipycytoscape
```

Running the project - run the following from the root folder: 

```s
jupyter notebook
```

### Portfolios:

1. algorithms-portfolio-searching-sorting.ipynb:
* Asymptotic notation
* Time complexity theory
* Asymptotic analysis of searching and sorting algorithms

2. data-structure-portfolio.ipynb:
* arrays, 
* stacks
* queues
* hash tables
* graphs
* trees
* linked lists

### Code examples:
1. refer to the folder <i>./algorithms/ </i> for algorithms examples
1. refer to the folder <i>./data-structure/ </i> for data structure examples

### Print pdf versions:

refer to the folder  <i>./print-version-pdf/ </i>
